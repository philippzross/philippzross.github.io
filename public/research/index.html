Molecular immunology in the Adams Lab
During my Ph.D. in the Adams Lab, I worked mainly on two proteins that play important roles in the innate and adaptive immune response: the archaic HLA-B*73:01 and the non-classical HLA-F. Both molecules serve as ligands for polymorphic Killer-immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), but it was unclear exactly how.
