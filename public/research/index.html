Chicago Molecular Engineering As a postdoctoral scientist in the Mendoza Lab, I use display-based libraries to engineer cytokines and their receptors to manipulate their signaling properties with the ultimate goal of designing next generation protein therapeutics.\nStructural immunology at U. Chicago Biology As a graduate student in the Adams Lab I worked mainly on two proteins that play important roles in the innate and adaptive immune response: the archaic HLA-B*73:01 and the non-classical HLA-F. Both molecules serve as ligands for the germline-encoded, polymorphic Killer-immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), but how this occurs and the consequences thereof were unclear when I began my work.\nIn the case of HLA-B*73:01, it was known that similar to other class I molecules, HLA-B*73:01 presents “short” peptides on the surface of cells. However, what I was interested was in what ways HLA-B*73:01 was different to other class I molecules. To learn more about HLA-B*73:01, check out our preprint here, while the manuscript is under review.\nIn the case of HLA-F, the questions were more fundamental. It was thought that unlike other class I molecules, HLA-F did not need to form a heterodimer with β2M in order to be expressed on the surface of cells. Charlie Dulberger, a former mentor of mine in the Adams lab, showed that HLA-F could also present peptides similar to all other class I molecules. So then which is the “true” form and what regulates the expression of these different forms? A preprint of my work on HLA-F is in preparation as well.\nFor the most thorough overview of my graduate work, feel free to check out my thesis.\nPlasmodium computational genomics in the Llinás Lab As a member of the Llinás Lab I contributed to work in understanding transcriptional regulation in the deadliest human-infecting parasite that causes malaria, Plasmodium falciparum.\nPrimary contributions resulted in the following publications:\nRed Blood Cell Invasion by the Malaria Parasite Is Coordinated by the PfAP2-I Transcription Factor Refining the transcriptome of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum using amplification-free RNA-seq Want to investigate our data yourself?
